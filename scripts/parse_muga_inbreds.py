"""
Script to take a CSV file containing a list of inbred strain sample for the
MUGA genotyping platform and generate a FinalReport.txt and a Sample_Map.txt
file.  The goal is to put the data into a format that can be uploaded to
HaploQA through the user interface.  The inbred strains are necessary so that
you can set haplotype candidate samples for given strains to be used in
haplotype reconstruction.

The file we are parsing was contributed by Matthew Blanchard at UNC.  UNC
did not have the original sample final report files, but they had loaded
the main data we needed to regenerate.  What we do not have is the sample
detail information that would normally appear in the [Header] section of
a final report file.

This script is really intended to be run once.  It will be committed to
the repository, but the data file is not.  If for some reason you are setting
up a new database and want to regenerate the final report file, contact Dave
Walton or Anna Lamoureux at JAX.

Expected format of the input file is CSV with the following columns:
  sample_id
  group_name
  sample_alias
  sex
  sample_flags
  snp_id
  snp_name
  chromosome
  position
  snp_flags
  call
  x
  y
  gcScore
  theta
  r
  x_raw
  y_raw

Assumption:  The file is ordered by sample_alias and then
by marker.
