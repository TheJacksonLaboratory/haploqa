    # to have two properties:
    #
    # 1) all characters used should be easy to visually distinguish. For this reason we exclude
    #    '1', 'L', '0' and 'O'. We also limit ourselves to upper-case.
    # 2) they should be short so that they're easy to remember and don't take up too much space.
    #    Using almost all of the upper-case alphanumeric characters in our alphabet helps us
    #    generate short IDs
    #
    # The full alphabet we use is [0-9] + [A-H] + [J-K] + [M, N] + [P-Z] for a total of 32 characters
