    <h2>About HaploQA</h2>

    <p>Current Version: {{ app_version }}</p>

    <p>
        The HaploQA web application was developed at the Jackson Laboratory to facilitate genetic
        quality assurance of mice using genotype data derived from genotyping platforms such
        as GigaMUGA and MegaMUGA. <b style="text-decoration: underline">TODO: add more detail here about the types of use-cases that
        this application covers (eg. haplotype reconstruction, annotating samples, working with GEMMs)</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Respository & License</h2>

    <p>
        The HaploQA source code can be obtained from the
        <a href="https://github.com/jaxcs/HaploQA">public repository</a>.
