HOW TO RUN THESE TESTS
----------------------
Currently the tests folder in the HaploQA project includes only tests that can be run using the python
unittest tool.

You will run these tests from the project src directory (so that tests is a subdirectory).

Before you can run these tests, you'll need to put the 'src' directory into your python path:

export PYTHONPATH=src/

Syntax for running tests -

To run one test file (all classes in the file)

    python -m unittest tests.test_haploqa

Run in verbose mode (reccomended as this shows the test name being run and its relevant comments:

    python -m unittest -v tests.test_haploqa

To run one test class

   python -m unittest tests.test_haploqa.TestHaploQA

To run one test

    python -m unittest tests.test_haploqa.TestHaploQA.test_home_page
