TODO description of what this app does

## Installation

HaploQA requires Python 3.  Begin by installing that. In order to install HaploQA you must first install and configure MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Celery and apache with mod_wsgi. Assuming for a development installation you are working on a mac you can use the following instructions.  For CENTOS there will be simalar commands using yum.

I prefer to work from a VirtualEnv.  If you don't already have virtualenv you'll want to install it:

    pip install virtualenv

once that's installed create your virtual environment.  Note: That if python3 is not in your path, you'll need to give the explicit path to it's location.

    virtualenv -p python3 HaploQA

then activate it

    . haploqa/bin/activate

then install all of your python project dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### To install MongoDB first update brew

    brew update

then install MongoDB with

    brew install mongodb

You'll need to create a folder for your database

    mkdir db

Instructions for starting Mongo are below.

### To install RabbitMQ

    brew install rabbitmq

Instructions fro starting are below.

### To install Celery

    pip install Celery


## Running a local (development) instance

> NOTE:  If you are running Mongo 3.2 or greater in your development I highly recommend you launch Mongo using the MMAPV1 Storage Engine.  Especially if you plan to load a back-up of the production database to your development environment.  Production is currently running on a 3.0.2  version of Mongo, which has a default storage engine of MMAPV1.  In 3.2 the storage engine changed to the WiredTiger Storage Engine.  I've found the performance of this storage engine to be abysmal on my Mac.  It's likely our configuration, indices and the size of our database.  At some point in the future we should put more energy into optimizing our database for WiredTiger.  Otherwise we'll need to change the production system to run with MMAPV1 when we upgrade Mongo on that server.
>        In order to run using MMAPV1 in Mongo 3.2 or greater you'll need to start Mongo the first time using the following command:
>
>       mongod --dbpath db --storageEngine mmapv1

Start Mongo like:

    mongod --dbpath db

Stop mongo with `crtl+c`

Start/Stop RabbitMQ like (not on the mac rabbitmq scripts will be located in /usr/local/sbin/) :

    rabbitmq-server
    rabbitmqctl stop

Start Celery worker like:

    PYTHONPATH=src celery -A haploqa.haploqaapp.celery worker

Stop Celery with `ctrl+c`

On OSX we can start the local postfix server like:

    sudo postfix start

On OSX to run the app from the command-line (for development purposes only):

    PYTHONPATH=src python src/haploqa/haploqaapp.py

## Running on Linux (tested on CentOS)

Start/Stop the Web Service Like:

    sudo service httpd24-httpd start
    sudo service httpd24-httpd stop

Start/Stop Mongo Like:

    sudo service mongod start
    sudo service mongod stop

Start/Stop celery Like:

    sudo service haploqa-celeryd start
    sudo service haploqa-celeryd stop

## Create an admin account

For a new installation you are going to need an administrative account to work through the system.  Once you have that first account created, you can create other user accounts through the UI.  

From the project root directory (where src is a subdirectory), run the following command:

    PYTHONPATH=src python src/haploqa/usermanagement.py
    
You will be prompted for an email address and a password.
